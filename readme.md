# Form&System API Documentation

The Form&System API is used to retrieve items from the clients database (and return data when in a context of the cms).
Data should be cached to minimize render times and the number of request.

The api is divided into multiple parts.

[Pages Api](#pages-api) | to retrieve single pages by `id` or `path`
[Streams Api](#stream-api) | to retrieve a stream by `stream`-name like `news` or `navigation` which is a collection of pages

## Pages Api
